<h2>What is Filipino Chicken Adobo?</h2>
<p><strong>In Filipino Cuisine</strong> adobo referes to the cooking method of (typically) pork or chicken slowly cooked in vinegar, crushed garlic, bay leaves, black peppercorns, and soy sauce. It is served with white rice. It was traditionally cooked in small clay pots (palayok or kulon); but in modern times, metal pots or woks (kawali) are used instead.</p>

    <li>15-30ml Neutral oil</li>

<h3>Let's Get Cooking!</h3>

    <li>Season the chicken lightly with salt. Heat the oil in a wok or large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned all over, about 4 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the ground and whole black pepper and the garlic and stir to combine. Add the vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, and bay leaves, and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil, reduce to a bare simmer, cover, and cook for 30 minutes. Turn chicken, cover again, and cook until the chicken is fully tender and the sauce is thick and coats the chicken pieces in a dark glaze. Serve the chicken and sauce with rice.</li>
